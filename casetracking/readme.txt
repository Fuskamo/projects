 Description : Case Tracking
 ============================================================================

Case Tracking is a project that attempts to organize support cases into a webpage to allow them to be searchable, sortable, editable and managable
The current state of the project is unfinished

IMPLEMENTATION:
The page uses local data structures to store data
This is not an efficient solution, although the entire application could be stored and run on a single machine without needing a configured web server with PHP/SQL
