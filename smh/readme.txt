Sentinels of the Multiverse (SMH) is a project that attempts to create a user interface for storing and tracking stats for the sentinels card game. 

IMPLEMENTATION:
The page uses local data structures to store data
This is not an efficient solution, although the entire application could be stored and run on a single machine without needing a configured web server with PHP/SQL
A database is strongly recommended
