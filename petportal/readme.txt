 ============================================================================

The PetPortal Database is designed to store information regarding your pets. The database allows for multiple owners to own multiple pets. A pet can be of any type, big or small. In a perfect world, every pet would have a home. Since this is not the case, my database supports foster care pets, for when an owner is unknown. Some of the information that is tracked includes required treatments, atypical treatments, vet visit history, vet treatment history, and pet weight history.
